  This category is for the casual hangman player that can't play too many games a day.
  It will use the first scored games to calculate a score for you. Each game is scored
  based on the amount of guesses you use, the amount of time taken and the difficulty of the word.
  <ul>
    <li>10 first games for daily</li>
    <li>35 first games for weekly</li>
    <li>70 first games for monthly</li>
